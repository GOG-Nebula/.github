## Hi there 👋

This initiative arised because of prolonged inactivity of @FriendsOfGalaxy account which used to manage and maintain unofficial integrations for GOG GALAXY 2.0. 

## Goals
- secure plugins maintained by @FriendsOfGalaxy: Steam, Ubisoft, Origin, ...
    - review and merge community fixes to avoid stuck pull requests like this one: https://github.com/FriendsOfGalaxy/galaxy-integration-uplay/pull/34
- be a source of secure plugins collection for GOG GALAXY
    - so that @GOG team can use it for autoupating plugins instead of relying on a list provided by @FriendsOfGalaxy account

## To achive those goals we plan to:
1. clone plugins that were maintained by FriendsOfGalaxy (without plugins maintained by external developers)
2. reuse FriendsOfGalaxy autoupdating system for externally maintained plugins to synchronize them periodically and review changes for security reasons
3. setup secure organization rules so that any change in plugins can be done only with approval of a few of trusted developers
4. convince GOG to switch their sources from dead FriendsOfGalaxy account to this organization*

\* if the last step fails we will create our own plugins updater.

## Non goals (for now):
- taking care of abandoned plugins
- fixing issues and providing new features for popular plugins
- create and improve useful tools and knowledge base for plugin developers
